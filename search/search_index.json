The precision is an optional integer specifying the number of decimal places for a floating point number. For example, the format \"core.millis input.level motor.position:3\" might yield an output like \"92456 1 12.789 . Bluetooth \u00b6 Lizard can receive messages via Bluetooth Low Energy, and also send messages in return to a connected device. Simply create a Bluetooth module with a device name of your choice.

Constructor Description Arguments mcp = Mcp23017([port[, sda[, scl[, address[, clk_speed]]]]]) See below int s The constructor expects up to five arguments: port : 0 or 1, since the ESP32 has two I2C ports (default: 0) sda : SDA pin (default: 21) scl : SCL pin (default: 22) address : client address of the MCP (0x20..0x28, default: 0x20) clk_speed : I2C clock speed (default: 100000) Properties Description Data type mcp.levels Levels of all 16 pins int mcp.inputs Input mode of all 16 pins int mcp.pullups Pull-up resistors for all 16 pins int The properties levels , inputs and pullups contain binary information for all 16 pins in form of a 16 bit unsigned integer. Methods Description Arguments mcp.levels(value) Set levels of all 16 pins int mcp.inputs(value) Set input mode of all 16 pins int mcp.pullups(value) Set pull-up resistors for all 16 pins int The methods levels() , inputs() and pullups() expect a 16 bit unsigned integer value containing binary information for all 16 pins. Use inputs() to configure input and output pins, e.g. inputs(0xffff) all inputs or inputs(0x0000) all outputs. While levels() will only affect output pins, pullups() will only affect the levels of input pins. Using an MCP23017 port expander module you can not only access individual pins. You can also instantiate the following modules passing the mcp instance as the first argument: Input: input = Input(mcp, pin) Output: output = Output(mcp, pin) Linear motor: motor = LinearMotor(mcp, move_in, move_out, end_in, end_out) The pins pin , move_in , move_out , end_in and end_out are numbers from 0 to 15 referring to A0...A7 and B0...B7 on the MCP23017.

Constructor Description Arguments serial = Serial(rx, tx, baud, num) RX/TX pins, baud rate, UART number 4x int Methods Description Arguments serial.send(b0, b1, b2, ...) Send a number of bytes int s serial.read() Read and output current buffer This module might be used by other modules that communicate with peripherals via serial.

Linear motor \u00b6 This module controls a linear actuator via two output pins (move in, move out) and two input pins reading two limit switches (end in, end out). Constructor Description Arguments motor = LinearMotor(move_in, move_out, end_in, end_out) motor control pins and limit switches 4x int Properties Description Data type motor.in Motor is in \"in\" position bool motor.out Motor is in \"out\" position bool Methods Description motor.in() Move in motor.out() Move out motor.stop() Stop motor ODrive Motor \u00b6 The ODrive motor module controls a motor using an ODrive motor controller . Constructor Description Arguments motor = ODriveMotor(can, can_id) CAN module and node ID CAN module, int Properties Description Data type motor.position Motor position (meters) float motor.tick_offset Encoder tick offset float motor.m_per_tick Meters per encoder tick float motor.reversed Reverse motor direction bool Methods Description Arguments motor.zero() Set current position as zero position motor.power(torque) Move with given torque float motor.speed(speed) Move with given speed (m/s) float motor.position(position) Move to given position (m) float motor.limits(speed, current) Set speed (m/s) and current (A) limits float , float motor.off() Turn motor off (idle state) ODrive Wheels \u00b6 The ODrive wheels module combines to ODrive motors and provides odometry and steering for differential wheeled robots. Constructor Description Arguments wheels = ODriveWheels(left_motor, left_motor) Two ODrive motor modules two ODrive motor modules Properties Description Data type wheels.width wheel distance (m) float wheels.linear_speed Forward speed (m/s) float wheels.angular_speed Turning speed (rad/s) float wheels.enabled Whether motors react to commands bool Methods Description Arguments wheels.power(left, right) Move with torque per wheel float , float wheels.speed(linear, angular) Move with linear / angular speed (m/s, rad/s) float , float wheels.off() Turn both motors off (idle state) When the wheels are not enabled , power and speed method calls are ignored. This allows disabling the wheels permanently by setting enabled = false in conjunction with calling the off() method. Now the vehicle can be pushed manually with motors turned off, without taking care of every line of code potentially re-activating the motors. RMD Motor \u00b6 The RMD motor module controls a Gyems RMD motor via CAN. Constructor Description Arguments rmd = RmdMotor(can, motor_id) CAN module and motor ID (1..8) CAN module, int Properties Description Data type rmd.position Multi-turn motor position (deg) float rmd.ratio Transmission from motor to shaft (default: 6) float rmd.torque Current torque float rmd.speed Current speed (deg/s) float rmd.can_age Time since last CAN message from motor (s) float rmd.map_distance Distance to leading motor (deg) float rmd.map_speed Computed speed to follow leading motor (deg/s) float Methods Description Arguments rmd.power(torque) Move with given torque (-32..32 A) float rmd.speed(speed) Move with given speed (deg/s) float rmd.position(pos) Move to and hold at pos (deg) float rmd.position(pos, speed) Move to and hold at pos (deg) with max. speed (deg/s) float , float rmd.stop() Stop motor (but keep operating state) rmd.resume() Resume motor (continue in state from before stop command) rmd.off() Turn motor off (clear operating state) rmd.hold() Hold current position rmd.map(leader) Map another RMD with current offset and scale 1 RMD module rmd.map(leader, m) Map another RMD with current offset and scale m RMD module, 1x float rmd.map(leader, m, n) Map another RMD with offset n and scale m RMD module, 2x float rmd.map(leader, a, b, c, d) Map another RMD from interval (a, b) to (c, d) RMD module, 4x float rmd.unmap() Stop mapping rmd.get_health() Print temperature (C), voltage (V) and error code rmd.get_pid() Print PID parameters Kp/Ki for position/speed/torque loop rmd.get_acceleration() Print acceleration setting rmd.set_acceleration() Set acceleration int rmd.clear_errors() Clear motor error rmd.zero() Write position to ROM as zero position (see below) The zero command The zero() method should be used with care! In contrast to other commands it blocks the main loop for up to 200 ms and requires restarting the motor to take effect. Furthermore, multiple writes will affect the chip life, thus it is not recommended to use it frequently. Mapping movement to another RMD motor When mapping the movement of a following motor to a leading motor, the follower uses velocity control to follow the leader. The follower's target speed is always computed such that it catches up within one loop cycle. When the following motor reaches its target position and the computed speed is below 1 degree per second, the follower switches to position control and holds the current position. The mapping interval ( a , b ) should not be empty, because the target position of the following motor would be undefined. Any method call (except the map() method) will unmap the motor. This avoids extreme position jumps and inconsistencies caused by multiple control loops running at the same time. RoboClaw \u00b6 The RoboClaw module serves as building block for more complex modules like RoboClaw motors. It communicates with a Basicmicro RoboClaw motor driver via serial.

Furthermore, multiple writes will affect the chip life, thus it is not recommended to use it frequently. Mapping movement to another RMD motor When mapping the movement of a following motor to a leading motor, the follower uses velocity control to follow the leader. The follower's target speed is always computed such that it catches up within one loop cycle. When the following motor reaches its target position and the computed speed is below 1 degree per second, the follower switches to position control and holds the current position. The mapping interval ( a , b ) should not be empty, because the target position of the following motor would be undefined. Any method call (except the map() method) will unmap the motor.
